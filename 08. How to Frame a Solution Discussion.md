- How to Frame a Solution Discussion
	- When you’ve identified a problem to solve, you need to come up with multiple solutions, and for each solution, you need to discuss the trade-off. Then, after you have fully discussed the options and trade-offs, you should try to decide which solution you would prefer and why. After that, there may or may not be an active discussion with the interviewer, depending on the interviewer’s style. You should clearly articulate the problem you’re trying to solve and why that problem is important and interesting for the system design interview question.
	- Step 1: Identify and Articulate the Problem
		- You should clearly articulate the problem you’re trying to solve and why that problem is important and interesting for the system design interview question.
	- Step 2: Come up With Potential Solutions
		- Once you’ve identified the problem, you should spend enough time coming up with reasonable potential solutions. Since the system design interview is relatively short, usually, two solutions are good enough. Just make sure they are important. Unfortunately, most candidates just come up with one solution that doesn’t tell the interviewer about problem-solving skills.
	- Step 3: Discuss the Trade-Off
		- For each of the solutions, try to come up with pros and cons about the solution. For each trade-off point, think about whether or not it is that good or bad in the interview context. Try to tie this discussion back to the functional and non-functional requirements you defined with the interviewer.
		- For example, if your concern is about the durability of a solution because you’re using an in-memory store, you can reference how the non-functional requirement specifies the accuracy of the data isn’t essential. Then you conclude that as long as you asynchronously replicate the in-memory store, replication-lag leading to out-of-date data is still acceptable.
	- Step 4: Take a Stance on Your Preference
		- After you’ve discussed the trade-off of the solutions, you want to take a stance on what you think the solution should be, based on the information you have and the assumptions you’ve made. Don’t worry about right or wrong. There’s no perfect answer here as long as the technical basis for your supporting argument is sound.
	- Step 5: Active Discussion With the Interviewer
		- The interviewer may disagree with your conclusion deep down inside them, but that’s ok. An interviewer should judge based on how you justify your final recommendation and not on their personal preference. However, your fundamentals need to be logically correct and make sense. If they disagree with you because you are technically wrong, then, of course, that won’t look good on you.
		- Usually, disagreement happens when two parties have different interpretations of the assumptions, and your job as a candidate is to try to resolve that. Unfortunately, this requires strong communication skills, but having the right mindset will drive the discussion forward.
		- For example, let’s say you both agree that driver location doesn’t need to be accurate. You propose you can update every 60 seconds, whereas the interviewer thinks that is too infrequent and it should be at least every 20 seconds. 
		- Now, both are not wrong because the definition of accurate is loosely defined here. You have to neutralize the discussion and address the root of the problem. In this case, the problem boils down to: how frequently should the location be updated such that we still provide a good user experience? In this case, you can neutralize by saying, “To find the right frequency for the update, we can try to perform testing on the frequency and monitor customer feedback.” It shows maturity, and you’ve just proposed another solution to another problem!
	- Step 6: Return to Step 1
		- After you’ve finished the discussion, identify the next important discussion topic and impress the interviewer.
- Example Flow of a Solution Discussion
	- Step 1: Identify and Articulate the Problem
		- Now, we have a problem with 500k QPS, and each database from my experience can handle 20k - 30k QPS at best. So we have a bottleneck problem. If we don’t scale up, the database might be unavailable for an update. Even worse, the database can crash and the users won’t be able to get matched with rides, and availability is important for our design.
	- Step 2: Come up With Potential Solutions
		- I can think of a couple of solutions:
			1. Ask the driver client to update less frequently.
			2. Instead of going to disk, we can store it in memory.
			3. We can shard the database.
	- Step 3: Discuss the Trade-Off
		1. By asking the client drivers to lessen their frequency, we will achieve lower QPS. However, the location will be less accurate. The pro is that it is simple. We probably just need to change a configuration file, and changing the configuration file can be quickly done. Instead of updating every second, intuitively, I feel like 10s would be just as good since how far can a car travel in 10 seconds?
		2. We can store the location in-memory first instead of on the disk, but the problem is if the in-memory store goes down, we won’t have their latest information. The advantage is that an in-memory store would allow for higher QPS. Also, since cars are moving around, as long as we pick up another leader to take rides, we don’t need to worry about replication lag since we will get a ride update every 10 seconds anyway.
		3. By sharding the database, the advantage is there will be more databases to handle the throughput. The con is additional complexity. Depending on how we shard, we may need to conduct scatter-gather, and there’ll be operational overhead to maintain the shard coordinator.
	- Step 4: Make a Stance on Your Preference
		- “Option 1 almost seems like a no-brainer; we should do that one for sure since there’s a lot to gain with very little con. For option 2, since we’re building this from scratch, we don’t need to worry about migration from the database to the in-memory store. In-memory storage sounds like a good solution as well. For option 3, we might need to shard in the future, but for now, I believe option 1 and option 2 will solve our issue.
	- Step 5: Active Discussion With the Interviewer
		- “So here’s my preference. Do you have any further questions?”
		[Proceed to discuss if the interviewer has questions and follow ups.]
	- Step 6: Go to Step 1
		- “If not, we can talk about the next discussion point I have on my list.”
- Priority of Discussion
	- Now that we’ve listed many ideas for discussion points, you might be wondering which of the discussion points you should be talking about because, after all, the interview is only so long. You should try to read the room on what the interviewer is interested in. If the interviewer wants to know what you think is important, try to identify scenarios that will likely happen and are hard to solve.
	- The way you should think about solution is that the impact of the problem is left untouched. Will the users leave your application, or will your company go out of business because you’re spending way too much money on the infrastructure? Think about the severity of the impact. If it’s not a problem, don’t invest too much time into it. Like other pieces of advice, focus on points that are unique to the situation, not generic technologies that are irrelevant to the question.
