### system design fundamentals:
- System Design Interview Framework Flow
	- **Step 1: Gather Requirements**
		- This flow makes sense because when the interviewer asks a question, you should clarify the requirements and the question to establish the baseline and assumptions for the interview question. Afterward, you want to have a top-down approach starting from the API and working to the bottom to the schema and data structures. If you start from the middle, it’s hard to conceptualize the overall big picture.
		- Functional Requirement Timing
			- Timing: 2 minutes
			- The functional requirement gathering phase is just feature gathering. Really try to understand what you’re designing for, but don’t spend an exorbitant amount of time here.
		- Non-Functional Requirement Timing
			- Timing: 3-5 minutes
			- The non-functional gathering phase is critically important, and these are things that make your design unique and very engineering-focused. You should spend more time here.
	- **Step 2: Design API**
		- Timing: 3-5 minutes
		- API should be after requirement gathering because APIs are the entry point to your system. After you have the requirements, it should be clear what APIs you will need. If you try to jump into high-level diagrams or schemas right away, it can be confusing because your design might have multiple APIs.
	- **Step 3: Define High-Level Diagram**
		- Timing: 5-7 minutes
		- After you finish designing the API, it makes sense to start fulfilling the APIs by connecting the components.
	- **Step 4: Define Schema and Data Structure**
		- Timing: 5-7 minutes
		- Now that it is clear which databases, queue, in-memory, and apps you have from the high-level diagram, you can naturally progress to providing more details on the schema and data structures for those components. If you feel like the storage calculation will impact your later designs, feel free to do the math after the schema.
	- **Step 5: End to End Flow**
		- Timing: 2-3 minutes
		- Before going into deep dives, just take a moment to summarize the flow you have to ensure there is at least a working solution that satisfies the requirements.
	- **Step 6: Discuss Deep Dives**
		- Timing: 15-20 minutes
		- By this point, you should have a working design. Your job now is to identify bottlenecks or dig deeper into components. What you choose to talk about is very telling about your design sense. You can use back-of-the-envelope math to justify a scalability need. Doing well in the deep dive section will set you apart from other candidates and could lead to a more senior-level position. Ideally, you should find 2 to 3 good solid deep dive discussions, although it’s not a hard rule, depending on the context.
