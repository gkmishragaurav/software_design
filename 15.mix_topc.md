- Vertical scaling vs horizontal scaling
	- Vertical scaling, referred to as “scale up”, means the process of adding more power (CPU,RAM, etc.) to your servers. - Horizontal scaling, referred to as “scale-out”, allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources.
	- When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option, and the simplicity of vertical scaling is its main advantage. Unfortunately, it comes with serious limitations.
		- Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to single server.
		- Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely.
	- Horizontal scaling is more desirable for large scale applications due to the limitations of vertical scaling.
	- Let's take example of 1 server based system. If users are connected to the web server directly. Users will unable to access the website if the web server is offline. In another scenario, if many users access the web server simultaneously and it reaches the web server’s load limit, users generally experience slower response or fail to connect to the server. A load balancer is the best technique to address these problems.
- Advantages of horizontal scaling
   	- Scaling is easier from a hardware perspective - All horizontal scaling requires you to do is add additional machines to your current pool. It eliminates the need to analyze which system specifications you need to upgrade.
    - Fewer periods of downtime - Because you’re adding a machine, you don’t have to switch the old machine off while scaling. If done effectively, there may never be a need for downtime and clients are less likely to be impacted.
    - Increased resilience and fault tolerance - Relying on a single node for all your data and operations puts you at a high risk of losing it all when it fails. Distributing it among several nodes saves you from losing it all. 
    - Increased performance - If you are using horizontal scaling to manage your network traffic, it allows for more endpoints for connections, considering that the load will be delegated among multiple machines.     
- Disadvantages of horizontal scaling
    - Increased complexity of maintenance and operation - Multiple servers are harder to maintain than a single server is. Additionally, you will need to add software for load balancing and possibly virtualization. Backing up your machines may also become a little more complex. You will need to ensure that nodes synchronize and communicate effectively. 
    - Increased Initial costs - Adding new servers is far more expensive than upgrading old ones.   
- Advantages of vertical scaling
    - Cost-effective - Upgrading a pre-existing server costs less than purchasing a new one. Additionally, you are less likely to add new backup and virtualization software when scaling vertically. Maintenance costs may potentially remain the same too.
    - Less complex process communication - When a single node handles all the layers of your services, it will not have to synchronize and communicate with other machines to work. This may result in faster responses.
    - Less complicated maintenance - Not only is maintenance cheaper but it is less complex because of the number of nodes you will need to manage. 
    - Less need for software changes - You are less likely to change how the software on a server works or how it is implemented.
- Disadvantages of vertical scaling
    - Higher possibility for downtime - Unless you have a backup server that can handle operations and requests, you will need some considerable downtime to upgrade your machine. 
    - Single point of failure - Having all your operations on a single server increases the risk of losing all your data if a hardware or software failure was to occur. 
    - Upgrade limitations - There is a limitation to how much you can upgrade a machine. Every machine has its threshold for RAM, storage, and processing power. 
- Which Should You Choose And When?
	- Both horizontal and vertical scaling have their own benefits and limitations. Since there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for organizations, you need to scale according to your needs and resources. Here are a few factors to consider along with which type of scaling suits the situation best:  
	    - Cost - Initial hardware costs for horizontal upgrades are higher. If you are working on a tight budget and need to add more resources to your infrastructure quickly and cheaply, then vertical scaling may be the best option for you.
	    - Future-proofing - Adding additional updated machines through horizontal scaling will increase the overall performance threshold of your organization. There is a limit to how much you can vertically scale a single node and it may not be able to handle the demands of the future.
	    - Topographic distribution - If you plan to have nationwide or global clients, it is unreasonable to expect them all to access your services from a single machine in a single location. In a situation like this, you’ll need to horizontally scale your resources to maintain your service level agreement (SLA).
	    - Reliability - Horizontal scaling may offer you a more reliable system. It increases redundancy and ensures that you are not relying on a single machine. If one machine fails, another may be able to pick up the slack temporarily. 
	    - Upgradability and flexibility - If you are running your application’s tiers on individual machines, they are easier to decouple and upgrade without any downtime.
	    - Performance and complexity - Performance will depend on how your services work and how they are interconnected. Simple straightforward applications won’t benefit much from being run on multiple machines. In fact, it may degrade its quality. Sometimes it’s better to leave the application as is and upgrade the hardware to meet demand. Horizontal scaling may require you to rewrite the code or add a virtual machine that unifies all the servers.
