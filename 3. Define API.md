- **Purpose**
	- The purpose of the API is to have a detailed agreement between the end-user and the backend system. Having a detailed API contract gives you and the interviewer confidence that you are both on the same page with the functional requirements.

- **How to Define API?**
	- API is a very broad term since it could be from a mobile client, web client, internal system, single machine inter-process call, etc. So what you have to define is contextual to the functional requirements.
	- If the interviewer asks you to design a ride-matching experience for a ridesharing product, you will want to define an API from the rider to your backend system. Likewise, if the interviewer asks you to design a Google Drive, you need to develop an API to render the initial dashboard and the subsequent pages when the user clicks into a folder. So you should make sure you define the wireframe well during the requirement gathering phase.
	- You will need an API signature, input parameters, and output response to define an API fully. Unfortunately, due to the time pressure of an interview, a lot of candidates forget and miss some input parameters and most forget to define a response. Incorrect and ill-defined APIs make the discussion very hand-wavy and incomplete.
- API signature:
	- Once you’ve identified the scope of the API that you need to define, you need to come up with an API signature that clearly defines what it does. Naming is probably the most important aspect to define clearly in this step. For example, if the interviewer asked you to come up with an API to request for Uber rides, name it “request_ride” instead of “rides” or “fetch,” which don’t articulate what the API does.
	- Our recommendation is to define an easy-to-read API signature like “request_ride” instead of a specific API technology like REST and protobuf. The interviewer usually isn’t interested in RESTful design so avoid elaborating on this unless they explicitly ask for it. Sometimes we’ve seen candidates spend 7+ minutes on just a RESTful design. Of course, if you sense the interviewer wants a specific technology, go with the flow, but in practice, not too many interviewers care for that.

- **Input Parameter**
	- The biggest warning we have for this section is that everything counts. If you decide to introduce an input parameter because it kind of makes sense, you need to be able to justify it if the interviewer asks you about it. The converse is also true; if you forget an input parameter, the interviewer might come back and question how you’re going to achieve a functional requirement without certain information from the client. Of course, if the input doesn’t make sense, you’re also going to be questioned about it.
	- Distracting Input Parameters:
		- You should not introduce input parameters that are not important to the functional requirements. If you give the interviewer more input parameters than needed, it doesn’t mean it is better; it is harmful in an interview since it’s unfocused and distracting.
	- Missing Input Parameter
		- Your API input parameters need to capture the functional requirements you’re trying to design. Missing input parameters will make the interviewer think you’re careless. Candidates miss inputs more often than they should. After you’ve defined the API, take a moment to ensure it satisfies your functional requirements.

- **Output Response**
	- Similar to the input parameters, the level of detail for the response is just as important, and everything counts. Unfortunately, from our interview experiences, most candidates do not define the output. The missing output makes the contract very confusing and open for interpretation. Like the input parameters, you shouldn’t include extraneous details irrelevant to the functional requirement or miss important responses necessary for the functional requirement.
	- Ensure the Response Satisfies the Requirement
		- Make sure your response includes enough data for the requirement you’re designing. For example, if you’re designing Google Drive and agree with the interviewer that folders should show up first, followed by the files, each list is sorted alphabetically.You need to ensure the response includes both the folders and files sorted alphabetically.
	- User Experience with Response Code
		- Usually, APIs will return some sort of response code depending on whether the server can handle the request. It is worth using the HTTP response code as a reference, but it’s unnecessary to map your design to a specific HTTP response code.
		- However, it is important to clearly define the user expectation for a response code you have specified. For example, if you are designing a request_ride API and the server returns a SUCCESS code, what does SUCCESS mean? For instance, it might be a success if the server has received your request and is processing the request, or if the server has fully processed the request and is letting the user know which driver will pick them up.
	- User Experience with Response Data Structure
		- You should provide enough details about the data structure. For example, the following two APIs look very similar but can be a very different experience and lead to significantly different designs:

		request_ride(user_id, pickup_location, destination)→{ driver_ids: [1, 2] }
		request_ride(user_id, pickup_location, destination)→{ driver_id: 1 }

		- The first one allows the user to choose a driver, whereas the second assigns the driver to the rider. For the first one, you may have to worry about the concurrency when multiple users pick the exact driver simultaneously. Take a moment to look at your data structure and ask yourself why you need the data and how you can use the data and make sense of the requirements.
	- Intuition on Inefficiencies
		- When you think of the output response, try to identify inefficiencies of the data structure, especially collections. For example, if you’re designing for News Feed, the response will usually be a list of feeds. You should develop the intuition that a list can be long and lead to a slow and impossible query when a user has a long feed list. If a user is fetching a list of photos back, try to think about pagination and thumbnails to identify the inefficiencies of the query.
	- Vague and Nonsensical Output
		- Similar to the input discussion, detail matters here. For example, if you’re designing Yelp and are querying for a list of points of interest, if the requirement is that the user can click into a point-of-interest for more details, you will need to return the point-of-interest ID such that you can send the server using that ID to fetch for more information. If you had designed it by returning a list of point-of-interest string names, it wouldn’t make sense.
