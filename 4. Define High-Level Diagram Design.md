- Purpose
	- The high-level diagram design aims to set up the foundations for the design and give clarity to the interviewer on which parts are important to have to achieve the requirements. In addition, having a high-level diagram gives you and the interviewer confidence that there is at least an end-to-end flow that satisfies the requirements.
- Position of High-Level Design
	- We believe high-level diagram design should go after the API design because the API is the beginning of the high-level diagram. We don’t recommend schema design after API because you don’t know how many data stores you potentially need. For example, you may need to store the ride record and driver location to design a ridesharing service. It will be a lot more apparent once you figure out the flow diagram.
- How to Approach High-Level Design
	- Where Do I Start?
		- You need to introduce a couple of microservices for a given system design question, and the fear is missing some of the components. Therefore, we recommend starting from the top with the API and working yourself down to the last component.
	- Step 1: Define the Client for an API
		- For a given API, think about who is making that API call and draw a representation of the caller. The caller could be a box, computer, or human figure, whichever is your favorite choice.
	- Step 2: Define the Next Sets of Logical Blocks
		- From the end-user, think about what the next logical block worth discussing is. Most of the time, that may be an API gateway to take in the user request. Then the API gateway forwards the request to an App server, and the App server sends a write query to the database. API gateway isn’t always required, however put it in if you feel more comfortable. Continue down the flow until the architecture thoroughly handles the API request.
	- Step 3: Repeat Step 1 for the Next 
		- After you complete the first API, you should move on to the next API. The next API should interact with the system you’ve designed from step 1 and step 2.
	- Example:
		- In this example, we will assume you’re designing for a ridesharing service to match riders with the drivers. The agreed-upon APIs in the API section are:
			request_ride(user_id, pickup_location, destination)
			update_driver_location(user_id, current_location)

	- This API-driven high-level diagram design may seem obvious, but many candidates still make mistakes because they don’t have a systematic approach. Some candidates simply list out the microservices. It is easy to forget a microservice if you are listing them out.
	- Other candidates mistake jumping into the “main” microservice and try to connect the diagrams. Sometimes they fail to identify the end-users and describe the end-to-end flow.
	- In the ridesharing example, you might also have many concerns, thinking this isn’t enough information and is not deep enough. That is ok. The goal is to keep it simple and to have a holistic view of the system first. After you accomplish the high-level diagram quickly and accurately, the next step is to proceed deeper with schema design and the deep dive.
- Don’t Be Distracted with Additional Features
	- Similar to API design, don’t start adding in a bunch of boxes that are unrelated to the core of the problem. There are two types of irrelevant information. One is designs that are not unique to the specific situation. For example, drawing a DNS server and authentication server is distracting since it’s not the main focus of the question. If you think adding those components is ok, then the question is, how far should you go? Should you also design a logging system, deployment system, and rate limiter as well? Again, you should keep the discussion focused on the core of the question.
	- The other type of distraction is introducing boxes and arrows for additional features. For example, in the ridesharing design example, if the only requirement is to match a rider and a driver, don’t start adding boxes like payment service, estimated time service, and fraud service, even though they are necessary to “the ridesharing design.
- Don’t Prematurely Optimize
	- The objective of the high-level diagram design is to get a flow diagram out in the interview as the baseline for further discussions. Many candidates feel obligated to include optimizations because they are something they’ve seen on a blog or they’re trying hard to impress the interviewer.
	- For example, some candidates like to introduce cache layers and sharding while going over the high-level diagram. Because the goal is to finish the high-level diagram, candidates who do this tend to be very hand-wavy with the justifications. 
	- To introduce cache layers or to shard requires solid justifications for the additional complexity. If you’re going to introduce complexity, please take a moment to think about the problem you’re trying to solve. Otherwise you’re at risk of digging yourself a hole without the complete high-level diagram picture and schema. To avoid digging yourself a hole, we suggest keeping things simple first, then optimizing later during the deep dive section.
- Have Logical Separation Between Services
	- The purpose of the high-level diagram is to bring clarity to the discussion, and you want to be clear on the responsibility of microservice boxes. Continuing to use the ridesharing example, let’s say the system matched a rider with a driver, then the system should notify the rider and the driver about the match. 
	- Thus, one responsibility is to match the rider and the driver, and the other responsibility is to notify them, therefore, you should separate them as two separate logical boxes for clarity. Even though in practice, you may decide to host both logical services on the same physical machine.
	- The suggestion might sound contradictory to “Don’t Be Distracted with Additional Features,” but it’s not because the interviewer asked you to design a notification system here. Even though the Don’t Do This example could technically work in an interview, as you add more components, it becomes more difficult to follow the API flow when services have multiple responsibilities.
- Depth Oriented Questions
	- Sometimes there will be questions that are more focused on the depth of a particular requirement. For example, an API rate limiter wouldn’t have too many high-level diagrams to talk about right from the start. That is fine, finish up the bare high-level diagram and then go deep into some areas worth discussing.
- Go With the Flow
	- As you’re drawing out the high-level diagram during the interview, the interviewer may interject and have you explain further. In that case, try to understand the context of the interjection and if they're just looking for a quick answer to a question or if they want you to dig deeper. Generally, you should go with the interviewer’s flow, but in most system design sessions, especially if you’re technically strong, you will be driving most of the discussion, and staying focused and organized will strengthen your presentation.
