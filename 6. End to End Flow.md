- **Purpose**
	- After your requirement, API, high-level diagram, data structure, and schema design, the purpose of the pre-deep dive design is to take a deep breath and walk through how each API flows through your system and whether or not they satisfy the original requirements. It’s also a moment to begin identifying any important talking points in the deep dive section.
	- We want to call this section out because almost all candidates immediately jump into scalability without making sure their system works and without identifying other important discussion points. Walking through the APIs and the flows also gives the interviewer some confidence that you and the interviewer have something that is working, which is a positive signal.

- **Situation:**
	- You’ve just finished the API, high-level diagram, data structure, and schema to satisfy the requirement to match riders with drivers.
	- For each API:
		- Step 1: Walk Through Each API and its Flow and Mark Any Interesting Points
			- When the rider requests a ride, the API will pass its user_id and the location. The location will go into the queue with (rider_id, rider_location), the ride-matching service will take the rider request event.
 			- Oh wait, maybe I can do micro-batches here. Let me come back to this.
 			- Then it will fetch from the driver table a list of driver_ids and their corresponding score.
 			- Hmmm, there might be some concurrency problems here but let me come back to this.
 			- Once the system matches the rider with a driver, the matched event will get broadcasted out to them.
			- The driver will update their location with user_id and their current location. We may want to talk about the push frequency, but generally, if the system didn’t match the driver, we don't need the frequency of a push because accuracy isn’t as important. We can dig deeper into QPS calculation if needed. After the location update, it will go into the driver location table, and the index will be updated.
		- Step 2: Ask the Interviewer For Next 
			- So I believe the current design will work for most of the happy cases. I have a lot of discussion points I’ve captured. Is there any point you would like me to dig deeper into?
