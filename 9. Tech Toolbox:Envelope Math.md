- What is the Purpose?
	- One of the purposes of back-of-the-envelope math is to justify a design. Let’s say you did a back-of-the-envelope calculation that resulted in 10^8 QPS, and you assume a single machine can only handle 10^6; you should identify that as a problem and come up with proposals to deal with that problem. It will look great on you if you can dismiss the need to scale based on the calculated results.
	- Conversely, if the numbers result in 10 QPS and you start talking about caching and sharding, it will not look good on you. Spewing random system design concepts won’t get you brownie points. You need to have a solid reason to introduce scalable solutions.”
- Do I Need to Do Math?
	- A lot of system design interviewers don’t want you to waste time doing some basic algebra math. If you are unsure whether you should, here are a couple of things you can do:
	- Ask the interviewer for QPS and storage capacity directly. They might just say, “Assume a lot,” which just means you need to scale. Or if they give you the QPS, it saves you a ton of time.
	- Ask the interviewer if you can just assume if you need to scale beyond a single machine. In most interview contexts, it doesn’t matter if it’s 5 or 50 machines. You need more than one machine. In practice, the magnitude of scaling does matter, so you need to proceed accordingly. The point is, you don’t want to waste time on back-of-the-envelope math when the interviewer isn’t interested.
	- If the interviewer prefers you to do the math, do it quickly, efficiently, and accurately, and don’t spend too much time on it. Practice it well using the strategies described below.
- Calculate QPS Formula:
	- Daily Active Users
		- The daily active user count is something that you should ask the interviewer. Sometimes they may tell you the number of users instead of active users. In that case, you assume a percentage of total users to be active users.
	- % of Active Users Making the Query
		- Sometimes not all active users will perform a specific action. For example, if the interviewer asks you to calculate the QPS for News Feed posts for Facebook, you should assume only a fraction of the users will post since most are just News Feed readers. Usually, 1% - 20% writer to reader is a fair assumption, depending on the application. Either way, you should clarify the assumptions with the interviewer.
	- Average Number of Queries Made by Each User Per Day
		- You should make an assumption of how many requests an active user makes each day. Even though the interviewer doesn’t expect you to know the real-life numbers, you should still apply some common sense here. For example, if the question is about the average number of News Feed posts per active user per day, 1 - 5 posts would be reasonable. Something way out of the range like 1,000 - 2,000 posts per day may raise some eyebrows. Of course, the interviewer may change the assumption since a system design interview doesn’t always have to reflect a real system. In that case, you should go with the interviewer’s flow.
	- Scaling Factor
		- Give a product scenario to show good product sense. For example, when requesting a ridesharing service, mention how weekend nights have more activity and that you’ll assume it has 5-10 times the average traffic. Since the above number is an average, you should multiply by some factor to consider the worst-case scenario. The point isn’t to show you can multiply a number with a number. The purpose is to demonstrate to the interviewer that you have thought about a potential bottleneck.
- Storage Capacity Formula
	- Daily Active Users, % of Active Users Making the Query to Persist, Average Number of Queries Made by Each User - Similar to QPS.
	- Data Size per Query
		- Make sure you consider all the data you’re storing. If you’re saving an Instagram post, make sure you remember to calculate both the photo and the post metadata. Most candidates try to be very precise about each column row data size and sum them up, taking a lot of time. Instead, just try to assign each column to a rough memory, sum them all up, and round it to a nice number. It doesn’t matter if a String column is 20 or 30 bytes. No one cares. If the sum is 68 bytes, round it to 100 or 50 bytes, no one cares if it’s precisely 68 or not.
	- Replication Factor
		- Generally, companies replicate a database into other databases for backup. Typically that number is 3. The point is to show the interviewer you have thought about it.
	- Time Horizon
		- You need to know the time horizon to plan for capacity. Usually, somewhere between 1-5 years should be fine. In practice, capacity planning is very contextual.
- Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation Techniques
	- Doing the back-of-the-envelope-math incorrectly during an interview will leave a bad impression and waste precious time. It is important to understand some of the techniques and practice before the real interview. We will use an example to demonstrate the technique steps:

		Daily active users: 200 Million
		% Of users who post photos: 20%
		Average number of photos per user: 10
		Memory per photo: 10 MB

	- To solve for the total memory can be quite intimidating and most candidates make mistakes.
		- Step 1: Convert All Numbers to Scientific Number
			- Multiplying 200 Million to 10 MB is very difficult and error-prone. You should convert the numbers into the scientific number (A x 10^b), then sum all the power of 10s together and compute the appropriate result.
			- Example: Calculate the amount of photo memory stored per day.
				- Daily active users: 200 Million→2 x 10^8
				- % Of users who post photos: 10%
				- Memory per photo: 10 MB→1 x 10^7
				- Average number of photos per user: 1 x 10^1
				- Replication factor: 3
		- Step 2: Group all the 10s together
			10^8x10^7x10^1 = 10^16
		- Step 3: Group all other numbers together
			10% x 3 x 2 x 1 = 0.6
		- Step 4: Find out the final number
			.6x1^16 = 6x10^15
		- Step 5: Convert the final number into a readable number
			6 x 10^15→6 Petabytes
		- Step 6: Do something with that number
			- Use Capacity Numbers to justify whether you need to scale or not. Assuming each host can only store around 1 TB, we need to scale up the servers.
